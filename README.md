# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
This is the project for ITCS 6156 Machine Learning.

The objective of the project is to predict the price of Bitcoins using a Live-Time-Series-dataset 
containing the day-to-day prices of bitcoins over a period of time.The dataset used is live data set of 
daily cryptocurrency prices collected from alphavantage API. This API returns daily historical time series 
for digital currency traded on a specific market. The prices and volumes are quoted in both the market-specific 
currency and USD.
Features: 
1. High: Highest price reached o
2. Low: Lowest price reached  
3. Open: Opening price of bitcoin on that day
4. Close: Closing price of bitcoin on that day 
5. Trading volume: Number of bitcoins that changed hands on that day 
6. Market cap:




The various commonly used approaches 
have been defined and presented in the project to provide the existing methods currently available.

Approaches shown:

1.Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

2.Auto Arima

3.Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

4.CNN over GRU

5.Rolling Window Analysis for predictive modelling.

  

The Novel Approach used:
